            Well, my (real) name is <label className="myname">Carlos</label>,
            but you can call me either <label className="myname">Aru</label> or{" "}

            I'm a 20-year-old Software Engineering student, but I'm also really
            into everything related to{" "}
            <label className="cs">Computer Science</label>; I fell in love with
            how things work under the hood.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite language is <label className="rust">Rust</label>, and as
            you can imagine, that's the reason for that cute, tiny, eye-catching
            crab moving side to side at the top of the page. Although, I usually
            program in:
          </p>
          <section className="languages">
            {Object.values(CURRENT_LANGS).map(
              (lang) =>
                lang != "Rust" && (
                  <p key={lang} className={lang}>
                    {lang}
                  </p>
                ),
            )}

          <p>Also, I'd like to learn:</p>

            One of the things I enjoy the most is solving logic problems. I'm
            sure you're familiar with platforms like{" "}
            <label className="leetcode">LeetCode</label> (my favorite btw ☝🏽🤓),{" "}
            <label className="hackerrank">HackerRank</label>,{" "}
            <label className="codesignal">CodeSignal</label>,{" "}
            <label className="codeforces">CodeForces</label>, and so on. I spend
            around 2 hours a day solving these kinds of problems.
          </p>
          <p>If you want to check out my profile, here's my LeetCode:</p>

            Yup, I've talked about my current studies, my favorite languages,
            and my obsession with LeetCode, but what do I do when I'm not
            programming? Do I play LoL like an average CS or SWE?

            I love <label className="gardering-label">gardening</label>. For a
            few months now, I've been growing various veggies in my garden. My
            dad grew up in a rural area, so he knows a lot about this wonderful
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually ☝🏽🤓, that's the reason I developed a garden organizer,
            which you can view in the{" "}
            <Link to="/projects">{SECTIONS.PROJECTS}</Link> tab.
          </p>
          <p className="gardering-text">
            At the moment, I'm growing{" "}
            <label className="waterm">watermelon</label>,{" "}

            <label className="carrot">carrot</label>, and a couple more veggies.
            In the <Link to="/life">{SECTIONS.LIFE}</Link> tab, you'll find some
            photos I've taken so far.
